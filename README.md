## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app is an inventory management system that is designed to help users effectively track and manage their stock. It addresses the organization and accessibility of inventory information, including item names, quantities, descriptions, and images. It aims to simplify inventory management for small businesses or personal use, to make it easy to add, edit, and monitor stock levels.
## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I used:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A dashboard or home screen that displays a list or grid of inventory items.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- An item detail screen that shows all of the details of an inventory item.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Screens for adding and editing inventory items, complete with form fields for item details.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A settings or notifications screen that manages app settings and alerts for low stock.  
My UI design focused on clarity, ease of navigation, and efficiency. I made sure that users could easily add new items, search for existing ones, and update or delete them with only a few taps or clicks.
## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approached the coding process with a focus on modularity, readability, and reuse of code.
## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
## In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
